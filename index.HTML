			<h1>Save the husky</h1>

			<h2>Care</h2>
				<p class="hu">
				Here at STH, we go above and beyond for our huskies.  We provide comprehensive veterinary care, obedience training, appropriate socialization, individualized affection time, offer enrichment opportunities,, play soothing music in their kennels, and much more!
				</p>
			
			<h2>Comprehensive Veterinary Care</h2>
				<p class="hu">
			Before adoption, our huskies receive: spay/neuter, heartworm test (pending a negative result, each husky is on subsequent monthly heartworm preventative), rabies/DAPP/bordetella vaccinations, flea/tick preventative, microchipping, and deworming. 
				</p>
			
			<h2>Obedience Training</h2>
			<p class="hu">
			The huskies here learn basic manners before heading off to their new homes!  We work on sits, downs, leash walking, come when called, and more if time allows!Some of the RHHR alumni have gone on to earn Canine Good Citizen titles, flyball titles, and are training in a variety of dog sports!	
			</p>
			
			<h2>Socialization</h2>
			<p class="hu">
				When at RHHR, the huskies receive temperament and behavioral assessments.  This is to gauge their natural inclinations in a variety of circumstances - with people and dogs!  We use these tests to match them up with canine and human friends alike!
			</p>

			<h2> Exercise</h2>
			<p class="hu">
			The huskies here have properly fenced acreage to run and play in, which is something crucial to the happiness of a husky!  The huskies also have a walking path through the woods on the property, to exercise AND work on training!
